* The Candidate Elimination Algorithm (CEA) is an improvement over the Find-S algorithm for classification tasks.

*  The Candidate-Elimination algorithm finds the most specific hypothesis that fits all the positive and negative examples.
  
*  We have to note here that the algorithm considers both positive as well as negative training example.

* This algorithm uses both positive-examples(Yes) as well as negative-examples(No) for prediction whether he can go out to play tennis or not?
